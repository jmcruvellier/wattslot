# Changelog

## 0.8.0

Home Assistant app quality: updates, backups and options.

- Updates from the app store: the app is published on its own branch, only once its image is online, so Home Assistant offers "Update" for each new version.
- Hot backups: before Home Assistant copies the app's folder, the app freezes a consistent copy of its database and graph; only that copy is backed up, and it is put back in place after a restore. Raw readings are left out (kept 3 days, rebuilt from Home Assistant's history).
- Options, in English and French: log level, how long raw readings (1 to 30 days) and quarter-hour data (31 to 3660 days) are kept.
- Clean stop: 30 seconds to write pending data before stopping; watched by the image's health check, so Home Assistant's watchdog restarts the app if it stops answering.
- Icon, logo and updated documentation.

## 0.7.0

First version planned for everyday use (development phases 0 to 6 bis).

- Reads your home from Home Assistant's Energy dashboard: solar production, grid, battery and appliances; history imported from Home Assistant's statistics.
- Daily plan and seven-day horizon: when to start each appliance, when to charge and discharge the battery, around solar forecast and electricity prices (single, off-peak, day colour or dynamic).
- Your home, your rules: appliance behaviours, time constraints, recurrences, battery settings, objective (cost, self-consumption, grid, CO₂), ready-made templates, backup and sharing.
- New interface: Today, Planning (agenda and detailed charts), My home in plain sentences, Assistant, Settings; guided first steps; five themes with automatic light and dark; six languages (German, Dutch, Spanish and Italian to be reviewed).
- Requests from the app or Home Assistant's Assist, reminders, configurable notifications.
- MCP server for Home Assistant's Assist (`/mcp`).
- Application status: problems explained in plain words, anonymised report.

## 0.0.1

- First development build: application state and connection to Home Assistant.
